### 문제 설명

<p>Everyone probably knows the game Zero or One (in some regions in Brazil also known as Two or One), used to determine a winner among three or more players. For those unfamiliar, the game works as follows. Each player chooses a value between zero or one; prompted by a command (usually one of the contestants announces “Zero or... One!”), all participants show the value chosen using a hand: if the value chosen is one, the contestant shows a hand with an extended index finger; if the value chosen is zero, the contestant shows a hand with all fingers closed. The winner is the one who has chosen a value different from all others. If there is no player with a value different from all others (e.g. all players choose zero, or some players choose zero and some players choose one), there is no winner.</p>

<p>Alice, Bob and Clara are great friends and play Zerinho all the time: to determine who will buy popcorn during the movie session, who will enter the swimming pool first, etc.. They play so much that they decided make a plugin to play Zerinho on Facebook. But since the don’t know how to program computers, they divided the tasks among friends who do know, including you.</p>

<p>Given the three values chosen by Alice, Bob and Clara, each value zero or one, write a program that determines if there is a winner, and in that case determines who is the winner.</p>

### 문제 설명

<p>Let the LIS of a permutation be the length of its longest increasing subsequence.</p>

<p>A permutation is good if it is possible to find two increasing subsequences of length LIS that do not share any common elements.</p>

<p>Given n, find the number of good permutations with n elements. As the answer may be large, you only need to find it modulo 998 244 353.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 75): the number of elements.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output one integer: the number of good permutations with n elements, modulo 998 244 353.</p>

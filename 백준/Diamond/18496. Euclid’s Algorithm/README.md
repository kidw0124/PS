### 문제 설명

<p>Euclid’s <em>algorithm</em> is one of the oldest algorithms known to mankind. It is used to find greatest common divisor of two given numbers. Your program should also take two numbers and find a greatest common divisor. And may Euclid be with you.</p>

<p>I give you two positive integers d and k. Your task is to find the largest integer that divides (a + d)<sup>k</sup> − a<sup>k</sup> for every positive integer a.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The only line contains two integers d and k (1 ≤ d, k < 10<sup>100</sup>).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print a single integer — the largest integer that divides (a + d)<sup>k</sup> − a<sup>k</sup> for every positive integer a.</p>

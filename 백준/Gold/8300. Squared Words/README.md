### 문제 설명

<p>A squared word is a word of the form <em>xx</em>, i.e., consisting of a sequence of letters repeated twice. Some examples of squared words in English are the words: <i>couscous</i>, <i>murmur</i> (= a low, continuous sound), <i>tartar</i> (= hardened dental plaque) and <i>hotshots</i>. We would like to find out, for a given word, how many letters should be removed from the word for it to become a squared word (however, not necessarily a correct English word).</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the standard input contains an integer <em>n</em> (1 ≤ <em>n</em> ≤ 1000), denoting the length of the word. The second line contains a word consisting of <em>n</em> lower case English letters.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The first and only line of the standard output should contain a single integer - the minimal number of letters that should be removed from the word for it to become a squared word. We assume that the empty word is a correct squared word.</p>

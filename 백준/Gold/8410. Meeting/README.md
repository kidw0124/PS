### 문제 설명

<p>During the second congress of Paranoiac Informatics Society (called simply a meeting), all members took their places round a round table. One of the members posed the following question: "What is the number of ways we can shake our hands without leaving our places? Every participant can shake hand of one person and this person must be his/her neighbour."</p>

<p>Since the congress participants are theoreticians, they asked you to write a program, which computes this number of ways. The participants hate big numbers, so they need only the last digit of the result.</p>

<p>Write a program, which:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reads the number of congress participants from the standard input,</li>
	<li>computes the last digit of the number of ways the participants can shake hands,</li>
	<li>writes the answer to the standard output.</li>
</ul>

### 입력 

 <p>The first and only line of the standard input contains one integer <em>n</em> (3 ≤ <em>n</em> ≤ 2 000 000 000), denoting the number of members.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The first and only line of the standard output should contain one digit, i.e. the last digit of the number of ways the participants can shake hands.</p>

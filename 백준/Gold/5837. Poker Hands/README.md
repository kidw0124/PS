### 문제 설명

<p>Bessie and her friends are playing a unique version of poker involving a deck with N (1 <= N <= 100,000) different ranks, conveniently numbered 1..N (a normal deck has N = 13). In this game, there is only one type of hand the cows can play: one may choose a card labeled i and a card labeled j and play one card of every value from i to j.  This type of hand is called a "straight".</p><p>Bessie's hand currently holds a_i cards of rank i (0 <= a_i <= 100000). Help her find the minimum number of hands she must play to get rid of all her cards.</p>

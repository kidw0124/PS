### 문제 설명

<p>John is a fan of amusement parks. He goes every weekend and plays different games. This weekend he found a challenging one - it is a target shooting game. The targets are placed along a straight line. For all target positions i (assume the target numbering goes from right to left), there are three possible points that John can win if he chooses that target: a<sub>i</sub>, if there are no neighbor targets chosen, b<sub>i</sub> if one neighbor, and c<sub>i</sub> if two neighbors. Could you help John choose the targets in order to maximize the number of points he can win?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The program input is from a text file. It starts with the number n (n < 1000000) of targets. Follows the values of a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, and c<sub>i</sub> for each target i. (0 ≤ a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub> ≤ 1,000)</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The program prints the maximum number of points John can win.</p>

### 문제 설명

<p>Sorting a sequence either into ascending or descending order is a common problem in real world.</p>

<p>One of the most common methods in sorting algorithm is comparing and swapping any two elements in the sequence. Supposed I have invented a new sorting algorithm which uses this swapping method. I need to compare the number of swaps occurred in my algorithm with the minimum number of swaps that actually needed to sort some sequences.</p>

<p>Help me determine the minimum number of swaps needed to transform a sequence of characters into a sorted sequence in ascending order. In this problem, you may assume that each character will appear at most once in the sequence.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Each line contains a sequence of lowercase characters S (1 <= | S | <= 26). There will be no repeated characters in S and each ith character (0 < i < | S |) is in range ['a'...'z']. Input is terminated by EOF.</p>

<p> </p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output a line containing the minimum number of swaps to transform it into a sorted sequence of characters in ascending order.</p>

<p> </p>
